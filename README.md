# Eza Finance

Eza.Finance is an enterprise that utilizes Web3 lending platforms to connect decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) with local financial institutions in Africa, such as Credit Unions and MFIs. 
The aim is to enable affordable lending to underserved groups like small businesses, women, and youth. By leveraging Web3 technology and settling payments in usable legal tender, Eza.Finance facilitates fast and accessible credit provision while fostering economic growth and development in Africa.
The platform sources funds from DAOs at competitive rates and converts them to local fiat eg. Kenyan shillings (KES). These funds are then onlent to Saccos, MFIs, and other financial institutions, which can use them to offer loans to their members or customers. The platform also facilitates the conversion of repayments back to the original tokens, enabling the return of the principal and interest to the DAOs
